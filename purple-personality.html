    <h1>Purple</h1>

  <h2>Compassionate Understanding Supportive impractical Arrogant</h2>
    <div class="info">



    <p>As a personality color purple, you are a generous giver,
      asking for little in return except friendship.
      You can be secretive, with even your closest friends not really knowing you well.
    You can be selfish and self-indulgent as you don't like being imposed upon by others beliefs and regulations.</p>
